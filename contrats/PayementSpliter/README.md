### **PaymentSplitter Contract Abstract**

The `PaymentSplitter` contract is a decentralized tool on the Ethereum blockchain tailored for startups, enabling automatic distribution of incoming Ethereum funds among its creators. The primary intent is to ensure fairness and transparency in revenue-sharing among the startup's stakeholders.

**Main Features**:

- **Flexible Initialization**: At deployment, the contract accepts a list of creator addresses and their corresponding shares, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to various team structures.

- **Automated Splitting**: Upon receiving Ethereum through the `splitPayment` function, the contract computes each creator's entitled amount based on predefined shares. The Ethereum is then autonomously disbursed to their respective addresses.

- **Transparency**: Stakeholders can easily verify revenue distribution mechanisms, ensuring trust and reducing disputes. Each creator's share, along with the contract's balance, is publicly queryable.

**Notable Points**:

- For simplicity, shares are defined as positive integers. The contract computes each creator's revenue based on the proportion of their shares to the total. E.g., for shares represented as 50, 30, and 20, the distribution would be in the ratio 50:30:20.

- The contract does not address potential remainders arising from rounding during division. In real-world deployment, additional mechanisms may be required to handle such scenarios.

**Recommendation**: 

Before any live deployment, it's imperative to conduct a comprehensive code audit to ensure security, accuracy, and efficiency of the contract.
